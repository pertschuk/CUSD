            <p> Two truths and a lie: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> I had two abnormal teeth growing in the roof of my mouth that I had to get surgically removed in 5th grade. </li>
                <li> I got food poisoning the morning of my flight back from Mexico this summer and had to stay an extra day in a hostel alone. </li>
                <li> I have a scar on my left eyelid from when I was a baby and my mom left me unatten in a stroller for a minute in a grocery store and I fell forward and landed on my face. </li>
